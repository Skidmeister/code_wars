# Codewars solutions

This repository contains python files with tasks and solutions to these tasks in form of functions.

The tasks are commented out and solutions are right below.

I use Codewars to challenge myself and to exapnd my skills in python and coding in general.

## Solutions which I am most proud of so far:
* traffic_lights.py - for complexity and combining classes in one programme
* darts.py - for complexity
* decode_morse_advanced.py - for difficulty level
* gratipay_featured_projects.py - for practical appliaction
* pig_latin.py and phone_directory.py - for implementing regular expressions
